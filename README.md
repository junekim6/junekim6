🔅 I'm a data journalist who's passionate about covering climate change and the environment. I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Data Journalism at Columbia Journalism School.

💻 A multimedia producer turned data reporter, I love making compelling data-driven graphics that draw readers' attention. See my [scrollytelling project about lithium-ion batteries](https://junekim6.github.io/lithium-lifecycle/) and [hand-drawn data visualizations about heat pumps](https://columbianewsservice.com/2023/05/02/heat-pumps-are-the-hottest-thing-in-sustainable-energy-but-new-york-lags-behind-the-trend/).

🧐 I'm a user of: Python, R, SQL, javascript, Illustrator, After Effects, QGIS.

🎹 Fun fact about me: I spent over a decade studying classical piano. While living in New York, I miss having a piano nearby to play. My dream is to someday own my own piano so that I can practice Chopin Waltzes anytime I want!
